# JavaScript
Getting started with JavaScript.  Using the console with JavaScript.

## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript was initially created to “make webpages alive”.

The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in the HTML and execute automatically as the page loads.
Scripts are provided and executed as a plain text. They don’t need a special preparation or a compilation to run.
In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.
